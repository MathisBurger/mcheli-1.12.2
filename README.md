# Project Information

This was an attempt to rebuild the popular MCHelicopter mod for the minecraft version 1.12.2. 
But I had to recognize that my knowledge of minecraft modding is not good enough to know what specifically 
changed in the Forge API from the 1.7.10 API to the 1.12.2 API. Therefore, I decided to leave this project as it is.
I do not think that I am able to rebuild the whole mod with my lack of knowledge in Java and especially in minecraft mods.

# Why kotlin?

Because I hate java I decided to use kotlin for the mod development. I don`t know if this was
the mistake I made, but I will not rebuild the whole mod using java. This is too much for me.


# Further development

This project will not be further developed by myself. If you would like to go on working on this feel free to do so.
Fork it, clone it or do whatever you want to do with it.
